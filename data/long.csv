– it is not permitted to make any such amendments to the Constitution that would deny at least one of the constitutional values lying at the foundations of the State of Lithuania, as the common good of the entire society consolidated in the Constitution—the independence of the state, democracy, the republic, and the innate character of human rights and freedoms, with the exception of the cases where Article 1 of the Constitution would be altered in the manner prescribed by Paragraph 1 of Article 148 of the Constitution, or Article 1 of the Constitutional Law “On the State of Lithuania”, which is a constituent part of the Constitution, would be altered in the manner prescribed by Article 2 of the latter law;
– it is not permitted to make any such amendments to the Constitution that would deny the provisions of the Constitutional Act “On the Non-Alignment of the Republic of Lithuania to Post-Soviet Eastern Unions”, with the exception of the cases where certain provisions of this constitutional act would be altered in the same manner as provided for in Article 2 of the Constitutional Law “On the State of Lithuania”;
– as long as the constitutional grounds for membership of the Republic of Lithuania in the European Union, which are consolidated in Articles 1 and 2 of the Constitutional Act “On Membership of the Republic of Lithuania in the European Union”, have not been annulled by referendum, it is not permitted to make any such amendments to the Constitution that would deny the commitments of the Republic of Lithuania arising from its membership in the European Union;
– it is not permitted to make any such amendments to the Constitution that would deny the international obligations of the Republic of Lithuania (inter alia, the obligations of the Republic of Lithuania arising from its membership in NATO, which are preconditioned by the geopolitical orientation of the Republic of Lithuania) and at the same time—the constitutional principle of pacta sunt servanda, as long as the said international obligations have not been renounced in accordance with the norms of international law;
– the Seimas is not permitted to make any such amendments to the Constitution that would deny the provisions of Chapter I “The State of Lithuania” and Chapter XIV “Alteration of the Constitution” of the Constitution; it is also not permitted to introduce by referendum any such amendments to the Constitution that would, without correspondingly amending the provisions of Chapter I “The State of Lithuania” and Chapter XIV “Alteration of the Constitution” of the Constitution, lay down the constitutional legal regulation contradicting the provisions of Chapters I and XIV of the Constitution.",Law_initiated,Yes

It doesn't indicate a specific time limit. It only states that the Prime Minister has to publish ""the start and end dates of the signature collection period during which voters may support the request to hold a referendum"". (Art. 5) 
In this context, it is interesting to refer to the ""Communication du Premier Ministre, Ministre d’Etat, sur base de l’article 5 de la loi du 4 février 2005 relative au référendum au niveau national"". On the second January 2009, the then Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker communicated that the signature period would last from the 19th of January 2009 until the 11th of February 2009. The ""communes"" are usually closed on saturdays and sundays but the law orgnizing the referendum especially states, that the ""communes"" have to be open on saturdays during the signature period.   REfering to the example of 2009, this leaves us at a total of 21 days.

Article 8 of the Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Expression of Citizens.,"It depends. According to the Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Expression of Citizens, the referendum could be scheduled for the purpose of deciding or for the purpose of consulting the citizens (Article 8). The decision adopted at a referendum for deciding is binding, but the decision adopted at a referendum for consulting is not binding. The problematic issue here is that in the Article 73 of the Constitution, it is predicted that the decision adopted at a referendum is binding. So, the Constitution is predicting that decisions adopted at referendums are binding, but the Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Expression of Citizens is opening the door for referendums scheduled for the purpose of consulting the citizens. Because of that, the Constitutional Court, several times was deciding about this situation. The decisions of the Constitutional Court supported provisions from the Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Expression of Citizens. According to the Constitutional Court, the Parliament has full right to initiate referendums with the purpose of consulting the citizens. Additionally, the Constitutional Court stated that such a right does not violate the right and obligation of the Parliament to initiate a mandatory referendum in cases which are determined by the Constitution. With that, the Constitutional Court supported the position that the Parliament has the right to initiate referendums for the purpose of consulting the citizens and that in such referendums it is a constitutional right of the Parliament to decide whether, when and how it will regulate the issue for which the citizens were consulted.",Legislature_initiated,Yes
