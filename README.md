# README

This template is for a github actions workflow that uses Renv on Rstudio. As a result, while being fully reproducible, it is quite heavy to work with. This particular template includes some of the basics, such as Tidyverse and Reactables. More complicated versions, for instance, for Shinylive and OJS, might require additional configurations with Quarto extensions.
